# MEV template in Python/Javascript/Rust

There are three MEV templates written in Python/Javascript/Rust.

The three templates follow a similar design pattern and are written for readability.

They all include an example DEX flashloan arbitrage strategy to demonstrate how the template can be used.

**NOTE**: the template is still under development. The Python version is the only completed project. I'm currently working on the Rust version, after which I'll work on the JS version using ethers.js version 6.
